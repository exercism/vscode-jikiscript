# VSCode JikiScript

Add language support for [Exercism's Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.exercism.org/) language: JikiScript

![Example highlighted code](./media/highlight.png)

## Features

- Syntax highlighting as of Level 9 (updated: **2025-03-14**)
- Snippets for common actions
- Language support (`.jiki`, `.jikiscript`, .`js` and embedded markdown)

## Known Issues

Not all highlighting is consistent, for example enumerators and enumerables in `for each` may be highlighted partially.
If operators such as `>=` or `and` are not highlighted, support for `keyword.operator.*` is missing in your theme.

## Release Notes

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)
